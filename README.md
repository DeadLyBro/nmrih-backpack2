# [NMRiH] Backpack: Ex
Fork of [Backpack](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=308217) by Ryan with NMRiH 1.11.5 support.

See original thread for info and requirements.
 <hr />
 
- Added support for NMRiH 1.11.5
- No longer using objective boundaries to manage glows, this should free a few edicts.
- Added `sm_backpack_glow_blip` (Default: 0) to control whether backpacks show up in the compass
- Added `sm_backpack_glow_distance` (Default: 300) to control the distance at which glowing backpacks can be seen
